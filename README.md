# Honk
> A barebones programming language of a college final. It can also honk.

![honk](docs/images/honk.png)

**Honk** is a rather peculiar language that can do most basic things you'd expect, plus a few extra tricks up his sleeve and an extra, second syntax...which is far superior than anything mankind has ever known.

In all seriousness though, this is my final for my compilers course. Brains were melted down, sleepless nights had occured, and my mind decided to say *heck it, let's make an obnoxious language to write in*.

Read the [site here](https://acluelessdanny.github.io/honk/) to see a proper write-up and reference of the language.

## Usage
The only requirements to using Honk is to be running on Python 3.6+ and have `numpy` installed (yes, numpy). Once you have those, clone the repo, and get ready to honk.

When you have a file ready to run through the compiler, run the following script:
```py
python3 honk.py <your file>
```
The file will run through the regular lexer and parser as normal, _but if you input a `.honk` file, you'll be running it through the **goose** syntax. You've been warned._
